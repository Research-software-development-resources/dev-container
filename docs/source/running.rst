Running IDEs in the development environment
===========================================

The instructions below illustrate how to run different IDEs in the development-environment from Windows, Mac, or Linux host operating systems. This will involve using the ``docker run`` command via the command line on the host operating system.

It is recommended that first time users start from running a terminal IDE as this tutorial provides additional context that is omitted in the instructions for running the other IDEs for brevity.
